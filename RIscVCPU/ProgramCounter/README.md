The program counter (PC), commonly called the instruction pointer (IP) in Intel x86 and Itanium microprocessors, and sometimes called the instruction address register (IAR),the instruction counter,or just part of the instruction sequencer, is a processor register that indicates where a computer is in its program sequence.
Here it's implemented by me.
